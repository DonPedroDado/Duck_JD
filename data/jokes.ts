  "A certain monk had a habit of pestering the Grand Tortue (the only one who\nhad ever reached the Enlightenment 'Yond Enlightenment), by asking whether\nvarious objects had Buddha-nature or not.  To such a question Tortue\ninvariably sat silent.  The monk had already asked about a bean, a lake,\nand a moonlit night.  One day he brought to Tortue a piece of string, and\nasked the same question.  In reply, the Grand Tortue grasped the loop\nbetween his feet and, with a few simple manipulations, created a complex\nstring which he proferred wordlessly to the monk.  At that moment, the monk\nwas enlightened.\n\nFrom then on, the monk did not bother Tortue.  Instead, he made string after\nstring by Tortue's method; and he passed the method on to his own disciples,\nwho passed it on to theirs.",
